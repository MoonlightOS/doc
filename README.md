# Welcome to MoonlightOS Document!
MoonlightOS is an AI-native Operating System based on Arch-Linux with alot of Changes and Improvements!

### MoonlightOS Layers
MoonlightOS does have some layers, which i'll explain it here now. 

MoonlightOS does have its own Linux Kernel fork named Shining, with +400k patchs and about 20% performance improvement and 40~50% being more accurate. we should not forget the security patches too ;)

Shining Kernel provides a better exprience than linux and its more secure, but how and why? everything starts with selinux (Security Enchanted Linux), this system absolutely makes the applying unauthorized changes to the system values impossible.

Whats too special about this kernel? well lets go back at the real subject, an AI-native Operating System. Shining Kernel aims at providing better performance with hosting LLM models in local system. Shining Kernel does have an integrated Inteligence to manage the internal things, dont worry about the security side, its completely offline.

Lets pass from the kernel now, i guess thats enough sir :). what do we have now? The Userspace. MoonlightOS provides many pre-installed tools for security purposes, such as aircrack-ng - tor. the userspace aims to be a secure operating system while providing many features as we can. MoonlightOS Graphical Interface is powered by KDE Plasma 6 desktop enviroment, an Open Source and Secure project. 
Everything used in MoonlightOS is checked in term of security and network conntections, they all are completely secure and Open Source.

### Key Features
- Running on top of our own Linux Kernel fork, Shining Kernel.

- Beauty is the key of hearts, we're using KDE Plasma 6 Desktop Enviroment.

- Security is the most important thing here, we have included almost +50 tools for every security purpose.

- AI is the subject where is it? We have Moonlight Assistant, Grunty, PyGPT & gpt-engineer.

- Our Insane Performance, oh man its better than every distro i've ever tried. (to be honest im planning to switch to using moonlightos after some backups)

### Whats the Moonlight Assistant?
Moonlight Assistant is a AI-driven Assistant that helps you to setup some agents to automatically complete some requests, like 

User: Create an admin dashboard in Node.JS with some cool themes
AI: Generates, tests, generates again, test, fixes the bug, Heres what you have requested me sir <codes>

When you start a agent on Moonlight Assistant, you'll specify a task for the agent, it'll generate and generate and generate and test and tests and test until the whole project is well

### Whats the Grunty?
Ummm Grunty is a little bit too experimental as theres no LLM model to do this better than claude. Grunty is a small tool to help you do your tasks when you're lazy. Just like this:

User: open firefox, go to <website_url> and find a picture from a Cat and download it.
Grunty: Does everything.

Grunty is a little bit slow but we will improve this soon-after. Grunty uses anthropic claude LLM model to perform In-Computer Vision tasks like that. very easily.

### Whats the PyGPT?
PyGPT is your absolute playground, you can do everything with the model, Torture the LLM mode, theres no restriction. You can generate Pictures/Texts/Musics/Videos using Online/Offline LLM Modes, which one do you choose? its based on your own taste!

### Whats the gpt-engineer?
GPT-Engineer is an alternative for Moonlight Assistant, if Moonlight Assistant didnt worked too well dont forget to try gpt-engineer!

GPT-Engineer is written in Python and its Completely Open Source just like others.


## MoonlightOS
MoonlightOS isnt finished and it still needs alot of works to do.
